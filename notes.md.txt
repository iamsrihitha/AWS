Client:   which request resource.

Server: which respond to the resource.

Devices can be either client or server.

1-Tier Architecture:
--------------------
Client and server are in single layer.

2-Tier Architecture: 
---------------------
Client and server are in different layers.
    server has application server and database  server.  

3-Tier Architecture:
-------------------
Client,application layer,database  layer are in different layers.
    
Application server:
------------------
The server which has application is hosted/deployed.

Database server:
-------------
The server which is stored database.

Internet protocol:
-----------------
It is a unique identifer for a device in the network.

Hostname:
---------
Name of the server.

DNS: Domain Name Server
----------------------

RNS: Root Name Server
--------------------
It checks the root names like .com,.in this are also known as top level domain.
 
SOA: Start of Authority
 -----------------------
It has the IP Address.

Firewall:
---------
It stops the unauthorized access to the network.

http: 80 /not secure connection to the application.

https: 443 /secure connection.

sh: 22 /connect to Linux.

RDP: 3389 /connect to windows.

Request travels in the form of packets. It stores the information of request.

Load Balancer:
-------------
It distribute the traffic  to multiple the serviers. It uses round robin method.

Protocols:
----------
HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
----------------------------------
It transfer the data to and fro from browser to server.

HTTP Status code:
----------------
404-page not found.

500-Internal service error.

503-service unavailable.

200-success, page found.


TCP: Transmition control Protocol
---------------------------------
Tcp acts as connection between two hosts/ servers.
It acts like a bridge.

OSI layers:
----------
There are 7 layers
1. physical layer
2. Data Link layer
3. Network layer(using IP)
4.Transport layer( using TCP)
5.session layer
6.presentation layer(SSH, RDP etc...)
7.Application layer (HTTP,HTTPS)
